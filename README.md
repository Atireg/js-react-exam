# 🧱 Salvaged Elements Platform/ kh ReUse
Welcome to my project!

This application is the result of a personal journey — bridging the gap between my work as an architect in the building industry and my growing passion for coding. After a year and a half of navigating these two worlds, I’m excited to finally bring them together in one meaningful project.
